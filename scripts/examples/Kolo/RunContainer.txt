2. RunContainer
Purpose:
This step launches the Docker container that runs the Kolo environment. The container is where you will execute further operations like training models, installing models, and more.

Key Details:

Initial vs. Subsequent Runs:

First Time: The container must be created and started using a special script.
Subsequent Runs: A simpler command is used to restart the already-created container.
Commands:

For the first-time run:
./create_and_run_container.ps1
For subsequent runs:
./run_container.ps1
What Happens:
These commands initialize and start the containerized environment where Koloâ€™s scripts (for training, installation, etc.) are executed. Running the container ensures that your local system now has an isolated workspace with all the required dependencies.
