1. BuildImage
Purpose:
This step creates the Docker image that serves as the foundation for the Kolo environment. The image bundles all necessary dependencies and configurations for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) locally.

Key Details:

Why Itâ€™s Needed:
The Docker image provides a consistent, isolated environment where Kolo and its underlying tools (like Unsloth, Torchtune, etc.) can run without conflicts with your host system.

Prerequisites:

Docker Desktop must be installed.
WSL 2 and HyperV should be set up (especially on Windows).
Command to Execute:
./build_image.ps1
What Happens:
Running this script builds the Docker image, ensuring that all tools and dependencies (such as Unsloth, Torchtune, Llama.cpp, etc.) are included in the environment for subsequent steps.
