5. InstallModel
Purpose:
After fine-tuning, this step installs the trained model into the Kolo environment, making it available for testing through a local web interface.

Key Details:

Overview:
Installation integrates your fine-tuned model into the Kolo system so that it can be served and interacted with via the web interface at localhost:8080.

Commands:

For a model trained with Unsloth:

./install_model.ps1 "God" -Tool "unsloth" -OutputDir "GodOutput" -Quantization "Q4_K_M"
For a model trained with Torchtune:

./install_model.ps1 "God" -Tool "torchtune" -OutputDir "GodOutput" -Quantization "Q4_K_M"
What Happens:
The script registers the fine-tuned model with Kolo, allowing it to be served and subsequently tested via the web interface.
