This PowerShell script is designed to uninstall an "Ollama" model from a running Docker container. Below is an in-depth explanation of each section of the script:

---

### 1. **Script Purpose and Usage**
- **Usage Comment:**  
  ```powershell
  # Usage Example:
  # .\uninstall_model.ps1 "my_model_name"
  ```
  - This comment explains how to run the script from the command line. You provide the name of the model you want to remove (e.g., `"my_model_name"`).

---

### 2. **Parameter Declaration**
- **Parameter Block:**
  ```powershell
  param (
      [Parameter(Mandatory = $true, Position = 0)]
      [string]$ModelName  # The name of the model to remove (always the first argument)
  )
  ```
  - The script defines a single mandatory parameter `$ModelName`. 
  - **Mandatory Parameter:** The script will not run without this parameter.
  - **Position:** Since it's at position 0, it's the first argument you need to pass when running the script.
  - **Type:** It expects a string which is the name of the model to be removed.

---

### 3. **Defining the Docker Container**
- **Container Name Variable:**
  ```powershell
  $ContainerName = "kolo_container"
  ```
  - The script sets a variable `$ContainerName` with a value `"kolo_container"`. 
  - This indicates the Docker container that should be running and inside which the removal operation will take place.

---

### 4. **Checking if the Docker Container is Running**
- **Container Check:**
  ```powershell
  $containerRunning = docker ps --format "{{.Names}}" | Select-String -Pattern "^$ContainerName$"
  ```
  - **`docker ps --format "{{.Names}}"`** lists all running Docker container names.
  - **`Select-String -Pattern "^$ContainerName$"`** filters this list to see if the container named exactly `kolo_container` is among the running containers.
  - If the container is not running (`$containerRunning` is empty), the script will output an error message:
    ```powershell
    if (-Not $containerRunning) {
        Write-Host "Error: Container '$ContainerName' is not running." -ForegroundColor Red
        exit 1
    }
    ```
  - **Exit:** If the container isn't found, the script exits with a status code of 1, indicating an error.

---

### 5. **Executing the Removal Command**
- **Try-Catch Block:**
  ```powershell
  try {
      Write-Host "Removing Ollama model '$ModelName' inside container '$ContainerName'..."
      docker exec -it $ContainerName ollama rm $ModelName
  
      if ($?) {
          Write-Host "Ollama model '$ModelName' removed successfully!" -ForegroundColor Green
      }
      else {
          Write-Host "Failed to remove Ollama model." -ForegroundColor Red
      }
  }
  catch {
      Write-Host "An error occurred: $_" -ForegroundColor Red
  }
  ```
  - **`try { ... } catch { ... }`:** The removal command is executed within a `try` block to handle any unexpected errors gracefully.
  
  - **Command Execution:**
    - **Informative Message:**  
      `Write-Host "Removing Ollama model '$ModelName' inside container '$ContainerName'..."` outputs a message indicating that the removal process is beginning.
    - **`docker exec -it $ContainerName ollama rm $ModelName`:** This command:
      - Uses `docker exec` to run a command inside the running container.
      - The `-it` flags allow interactive execution.
      - It runs the `ollama rm` command with the provided model name `$ModelName`, which should trigger the model removal process inside the container.
  
  - **Checking Command Success:**
    - **`if ($?)`** checks if the previous command (docker exec) was successful.
    - **Success Message:**  
      If the command was successful, it prints "Ollama model '$ModelName' removed successfully!" in green text.
    - **Failure Message:**  
      If the command failed (i.e., `$?` is false), it prints "Failed to remove Ollama model." in red text.
  
  - **Error Handling:**  
    If any exception occurs during the execution (for example, if `docker exec` throws an error), the `catch` block prints "An error occurred: $_", where `$_` contains details about the error, in red text.

---

### **Summary**
- **Input:** A model name provided as a command line argument.
- **Validation:** Checks if the Docker container `kolo_container` is running.
- **Execution:** Runs the `ollama rm` command inside the container to remove the specified model.
- **Error Handling:** Reports errors if the container isn't running or if the removal command fails.

This script is a neat example of combining Docker operations with PowerShell scripting to manage services (in this case, model management) in a containerized environment.
