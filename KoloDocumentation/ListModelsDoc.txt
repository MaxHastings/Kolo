This PowerShell script, named **"uninstall_model.ps1"**, is designed to inspect a Docker container for specific directories and list the models installed in two different ways. Let’s break down its structure and functionality step by step:

---

### 1. **Container and Directory Setup**

```powershell
# Define the container name
$containerName = "kolo_container"

# Define the target directories inside the container
$targetDirectories = @(
    "/var/kolo_data/torchtune",
    "/var/kolo_data/unsloth"
)
```

- **Container Name**: The script starts by setting a variable `$containerName` with the value `"kolo_container"`. This tells the script which Docker container to target when running subsequent commands.
  
- **Target Directories**: An array `$targetDirectories` is defined with two directory paths. These paths (`/var/kolo_data/torchtune` and `/var/kolo_data/unsloth`) are the locations inside the container where model folders are expected to reside.

---

### 2. **Iterating Over Target Directories**

```powershell
foreach ($dir in $targetDirectories) {
    Write-Host "Model folders in $dir" -ForegroundColor Cyan
```

- **Iteration**: The script uses a `foreach` loop to process each directory path stored in `$targetDirectories`.
- **User Feedback**: It prints out a message indicating which directory is being processed, using cyan-colored text for clarity.

---

### 3. **Listing Model Folders Within Each Directory**

```powershell
    # Build the command to allow shell globbing and suppress error messages if no folders are found.
    $command = "docker"
    $cmd = "ls -d $dir/*/ 2>/dev/null"  # ls will not print an error if no folder exists
    $args = @("exec", $containerName, "sh", "-c", $cmd)
```

- **Command Building**: 
  - `$command` is set to `"docker"`, indicating that the script will be invoking Docker commands.
  - `$cmd` is built as `"ls -d $dir/*/ 2>/dev/null"`. This command:
    - Uses `ls -d` to list only the directories (folders) within the specified path.
    - The wildcard `*` allows shell globbing to match any folder inside `$dir`.
    - `2>/dev/null` redirects error messages (for instance, if there are no matching folders) to `/dev/null` (i.e., suppresses them).

- **Docker Execution Arguments**: The `$args` array contains:
  - `"exec"`: Tells Docker to execute a command in a running container.
  - `$containerName`: The target container.
  - `"sh", "-c", $cmd`: Uses the shell to run the constructed command `$cmd`.

---

### 4. **Executing the Command and Handling Output**

```powershell
    try {
        # Execute the command and capture the output.
        $result = & $command @args 2>&1 | Out-String

        # If the trimmed output is empty, no folders were found.
        if ($result.Trim().Length -eq 0) {
            Write-Host "No models found" -ForegroundColor Green
        }
        else {
            Write-Host $result -ForegroundColor Green
        }
    }
    catch {
        Write-Host "An exception occurred while listing folders in $dir $_" -ForegroundColor Red
    }
```

- **Try/Catch Block**: The script wraps the command execution in a `try` block to catch any errors.
- **Command Execution**:
  - The command is executed with `& $command @args`, which is PowerShell’s way of invoking a command with arguments.
  - `2>&1` ensures that both standard output and standard error are captured.
  - `Out-String` converts the output to a string format.
- **Output Check**: 
  - If the resulting string, after trimming whitespace, is empty, it means no model folders were found in that directory. It then prints `"No models found"` in green.
  - Otherwise, it prints the output (list of folders) in green.
- **Error Handling**: If an exception occurs during execution, it is caught and a red-colored error message is displayed.

- **Separator**: After processing each directory, a yellow separator line (`"-------------------------------------"`) is printed for visual clarity.

---

### 5. **Listing Installed Models Using Ollama**

```powershell
# Now, list the installed models in Ollama using the 'ollama list' command inside the container.
Write-Host "`nListing installed models in Ollama:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
try {
    # Build the docker exec command to run 'ollama list' inside the container.
    $command = "docker"
    $cmd = "ollama list"
    $args = @("exec", $containerName, "sh", "-c", $cmd)

    # Execute the command and capture the output.
    $ollamaOutput = & $command @args 2>&1 | Out-String

    # Check if any output was returned.
    if ($ollamaOutput.Trim().Length -eq 0) {
        Write-Host "No models installed or no output from ollama list." -ForegroundColor Green
    }
    else {
        Write-Host $ollamaOutput -ForegroundColor Green
    }
}
catch {
    Write-Host "An exception occurred while listing installed models in Ollama: $_" -ForegroundColor Red
}
```

- **Introduction Message**: A message is printed to indicate the start of listing installed models via Ollama.
  
- **Command Setup for Ollama**:
  - Similar to before, `$command` is set to `"docker"`.
  - `$cmd` is now `"ollama list"`, which is intended to list models managed by the Ollama service.
  - `$args` is built similarly to the previous section, instructing Docker to execute this command within the target container.

- **Execution and Output Handling**:
  - The command is executed and its output is captured in `$ollamaOutput`.
  - If the trimmed output is empty, it indicates that no models were installed or the command didn’t produce any output. A corresponding green message is printed.
  - Otherwise, the actual output is printed in green.
  
- **Error Handling**: Again, a `try/catch` block ensures that if any errors occur during this command execution, they are caught and an error message in red is displayed.

---

### **Summary**

- **Purpose**: The script is meant for administrative or troubleshooting purposes—specifically, to inspect a Docker container (`kolo_container`) for:
  - The existence of model folders within two specific directories.
  - The list of installed models managed by Ollama within that container.
  
- **Techniques Used**:
  - **Docker Exec**: To run shell commands inside the container.
  - **Shell Globbing**: To list directories matching a pattern.
  - **Redirection of Errors**: Using `2>/dev/null` to suppress errors when no directories are found.
  - **Try/Catch Blocks**: To handle any potential exceptions gracefully.
  - **Colored Output**: Enhancing readability and clarity of the script's console output.

By combining these elements, the script provides a clear and user-friendly way to verify the state of models in a container, making it easier for administrators to understand what is installed and to perform cleanup or further actions if necessary.
