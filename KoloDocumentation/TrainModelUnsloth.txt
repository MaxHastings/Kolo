## File 1: `train_model_unsloth.ps1`

This PowerShell script is designed to serve as a wrapper that launches a Python training script (described in `Train.py`) inside a pre‐existing Docker container. Here’s a breakdown of its structure and functionality:

### 1. **Parameters & Usage**

- **Usage Instructions:**  
  At the very top, comments detail an example of how to invoke the script with parameters. For instance, you can specify the number of epochs, learning rate, file paths, model identifiers, and various hyperparameters.
  
- **Parameter Declaration:**  
  The `param` block declares multiple parameters such as:
  - **Training hyperparameters:** `$Epochs`, `$LearningRate`, `$BatchSize`, etc.
  - **Data/model paths:** `$TrainData`, `$BaseModel`, `$OutputDir`
  - **LoRA-specific settings:** `$LoraRank`, `$LoraAlpha`, `$LoraDropout`
  - **Other training configurations:** `$MaxSeqLength`, `$WarmupSteps`, `$SaveSteps`, `$SaveTotalLimit`, `$Seed`, `$SchedulerType`, `$Quantization`, `$WeightDecay`
  - **Checkpoint flag:** `$UseCheckpoint` is a switch that indicates whether to resume from a checkpoint.

### 2. **Parameter Display**

- The script prints out the parameters that were passed using `Write-Host`, giving immediate feedback to the user. This helps in verifying that the correct values have been provided.

### 3. **Docker Container Check**

- **Container Name:**  
  The variable `$ContainerName` is set to `"kolo_container"`.
  
- **Checking if the Container is Running:**  
  The script runs a Docker command (`docker ps`) to list running containers and uses `Select-String` to verify that a container named `"kolo_container"` is active. If it isn’t found, an error message is printed, and the script exits with an error code.

### 4. **Command Construction**

- **Base Command:**  
  The script begins by defining a base command string that first activates a Conda environment (`kolo_env`) and then calls the Python script located at `/app/train.py`.
  
- **Appending Arguments:**  
  The command string is dynamically built by checking each parameter. If a parameter is provided, it appends the corresponding argument (e.g., `--epochs`, `--learning_rate`) to the command string.  
  - Note how string quoting is applied for paths or string values to prevent issues with spaces or special characters.
  
### 5. **Executing the Command**

- **Docker Execution:**  
  Finally, the script uses `docker exec` with the `-it` flag to open an interactive shell in the specified container and run the constructed command using `/bin/bash -c "$command"`.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  The script includes a `try/catch` block to handle any exceptions that occur during execution and prints a success or failure message based on the outcome.

## File 2: `Train.py`

This Python script is focused on fine-tuning a language model using the PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) method. Here’s a detailed explanation:

### 1. **Shebang & Docstring**

- **Shebang:**  
  `#!/usr/bin/env python` makes sure the script is executed using the Python interpreter.
  
- **Docstring:**  
  The top-level docstring describes the purpose of the script (fine-tuning a language model) and outlines all the command-line arguments available to tweak various training aspects.

### 2. **Import Statements**

- **Model and Tokenizer Utilities:**  
  The script imports from `unsloth` (a custom or third-party library) to load a base language model (`FastLanguageModel`) and to check hardware support (e.g., bfloat16).
  
- **Chat Templates & Data:**  
  The `get_chat_template` function is imported to handle prompt formatting, and `datasets.load_dataset` is used to load the training data.
  
- **Training Infrastructure:**  
  The script uses `trl.SFTTrainer` (a specialized trainer for supervised fine-tuning) and `transformers.TrainingArguments` to set training parameters.

### 3. **Argument Parsing**

- **`parse_arguments` Function:**  
  Uses Python’s `argparse` module to define and parse command-line arguments. Default values are provided for most parameters, ensuring that the script can run with minimal input if needed.
  - The arguments mirror those expected by the PowerShell wrapper, covering data paths, model hyperparameters, LoRA settings, training details, and additional configurations like checkpoint resumption and quantization.

### 4. **Data Formatting Function**

- **`formatting_prompts_func`:**  
  This helper function:
  - Receives a batch of examples (with a key `"messages"` representing conversation data).
  - Applies a chat template (using the tokenizer’s `apply_chat_template` method) to format the conversation.
  - Tokenizes the resulting text without adding special tokens or padding.
  - Returns a dictionary with both the raw texts and their tokenized representation (`input_ids`).

### 5. **Main Training Routine**

- **Loading the Model and Tokenizer:**  
  The script calls `FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained` to load the base model and associated tokenizer. It also sets `max_seq_length` and enables 4-bit loading (a technique to reduce memory usage).
  
- **Converting to PEFT LoRA:**  
  The base model is converted to a LoRA model by calling `FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model` with LoRA parameters like rank, alpha, and dropout.  
  - The `target_modules` parameter indicates which layers of the model are to be adapted (e.g., projection layers).

- **Applying the Chat Template:**  
  The tokenizer is updated with a specific chat template using the `get_chat_template` function to ensure that prompts are formatted correctly during tokenization.

- **Dataset Loading & Mapping:**  
  - The dataset is loaded from a JSON lines file using `load_dataset`.
  - The `map` method applies `formatting_prompts_func` to the dataset, converting raw conversation data into tokenized inputs suitable for training.

- **Defining the Output Directory:**  
  The training output is directed to a specific volume path (e.g., `/var/kolo_data/unsloth/{args.output_dir}`), which may be a mounted volume in the Docker container.

### 6. **Training Configuration & Execution**

- **Training Arguments:**  
  An instance of `TrainingArguments` from the Hugging Face Transformers library is created with parameters such as:
  - Batch size, warmup steps, number of epochs, learning rate, and scheduler type.
  - Mixed precision settings (`fp16`/`bf16`) are set based on hardware support.
  - Checkpointing parameters (`save_steps`, `save_total_limit`) are defined.
  - The output directory is specified, and logging is configured.

- **Trainer Setup:**  
  An instance of `SFTTrainer` is created:
  - The model, tokenizer, training dataset, and maximum sequence length are provided.
  - Additional parameters like the number of processes for data mapping (`dataset_num_proc`) and whether to pack sequences are set.

- **Training Invocation:**  
  The training is started by calling `trainer.train()`, with the option to resume from a checkpoint if the flag `--use_checkpoint` was passed.

### 7. **Saving the Model**

- **Standard Saving:**  
  After training, the script saves the fine-tuned model and tokenizer locally to the output directory using the standard `save_pretrained` method.
  
- **GGUF Format & Quantization:**  
  - The model is then saved in GGUF format. If a quantization method is provided (e.g., `"q4_k_m"`), the script applies it during the GGUF conversion.
  - A special file is created (e.g., `ModelfileQ4_K_M`) with contents that reference the quantized model file. This step is likely needed for compatibility with a serving or deployment system.

- **Final Message:**  
  A final print statement confirms that the model was saved successfully.
